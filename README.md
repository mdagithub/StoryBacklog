StoryBacklog
============

This holds the entire Story Backlog before the stories get transferred to the implementation repositories.

Conventions
-----------
mdagithub uses the following conventions:

Labels can be prefixed and colour-coded to better organize them.

Recommended Label category (with prefixes):  
a - Issue type (mandatory)  
n - for additional tasks needed to complete development issues  
s - for development status  
p - priority  
q - for blocking questions or other impediments  

All Issus must be created with a label to identify their issue type (a-type)  
Issues can be created without a milestone, but a milestone will be assigned at the Scope Review meeting.
